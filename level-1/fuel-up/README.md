# Let's Fuel Up! ðŸš€
A vehicle needs 10 times the amount of fuel than the distance it travels. However, it must always carry a minimum of 100 fuel before setting off.

Create a function which calculates the amount of fuel it needs, given the distance.

## Example Output:
```
calculateFuel(15) âžž 150

calculateFuel(23.5) âžž 235

calculateFuel(3) âžž 100
```
Check out the implementation in fuel-up.js
