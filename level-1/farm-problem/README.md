# The Farm Problem 🧑‍🌾
A farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. 
The farmer breeds three species:
```
chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
```
The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

## Example Output:
```
animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
```
Check out the implementation in farm-problem.js
